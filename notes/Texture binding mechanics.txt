The texture to affect will be texture 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,and 7
We can take advantage of this by binding 7 textures at once then rendering each one one by one.
Or we don't need to do this and just keep binding it to texture 0 which will be easier.
We can have a texture bind list and keep track which texture is bound to which slot.
We can unbind a texture that we don't need.
