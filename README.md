# WebGL Library
Well, uh, this library doesn't have a name yet so please don't mind. Besides, I have no idea what to call it.
<hr>
So, this WebGL Library's goal is to make WebGL, the technology to enable hardware accelerated graphics on the web, more user friendly and easier to use.

Yeah not much else.

<hr>
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS LIBRARY IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE MISSING FEATURES AND THE CODE PROBABLY HAS SOME HOLES IN IT.

Before downloading, please read LISCENSES.md..

ATTENTION CREATORS OF THREE.JS, P5.JS, D3.JS OR ANY OTHER LIBRARY LIKE THIS,<br>
This software doesn't contain any of your code so please don't sue me. If it did, it is just a coincidence, as I haven't viewed the source code of any of your librarys other than my own.<br>
